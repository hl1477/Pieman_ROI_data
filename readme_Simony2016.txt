Experimental Procedures

Subjects

For the auditory narrative stimulus (‘Pieman’), we scanned 36 subjects who listened to the intact story, 18 of which were used in the primary group (10 females, ages: 18–33, Subjects 1-18, intact_1) and 18 for the replication group (15 females, ages: 18–31, Subjects 19-36, intact_2 ). In the paragraph scramble condition there were 18 subjects (6 males, ages: 18–31, subjects 52-69). In the word scramble condition there were 36 subjects (20 females, ages: 18–33, subjects 1-4;10-14;16;20;23-28;30-32;34-35;37-51) ). In the rest condition there were 36 subjects (15 females, ages: 18–30, subjects 70-105). All subjects were native English speakers with normal hearing and provided written informed consent.

105 different subjects participated in 126 scans, i.e., some subjects participated in more than one condition. Folders for each condition are nested within each subject's directory.

MRI acquisition

Subjects were scanned in a 3T full-body MRI scanner (Skyra; Siemens) with a sixteen-channel head coil. For functional scans, images were acquired using a T2* weighted echo planer imaging (EPI) pulse sequence [repetition time (TR), 1500 ms; echo time (TE), 28 ms; flip angle, 64°], each volume comprising 27 slices of 4 mm thickness with 0 mm gap; slice acquisition order was interleaved. In-plane resolution was 3×3 mm2 [field of view (FOV), 192×192 mm2]. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence (TR, 2300 ms; TE, 3.08 ms; flip angle 9°; 0.89 mm3 resolution; FOV, 256 mm2). To minimize head movement, subjects’ heads were stabilized with foam padding. Stimuli were presented using the Psychophysics toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). Subjects were provided with an MRI compatible in-ear mono earbuds (Sensimetrics Model S14), which provided the same audio input to each ear. MRI-safe passive noise-canceling headphones were placed over the earbuds, for noise removal and safety. 

Stimuli and Experimental Design 

Stimuli for the experiment were generated from a 7 min real life story (‘Pie Man’, Jim O'Grady) recorded at a live storytelling performance (‘The Moth’ storytelling event, New York City). Subjects listened to the story from beginning to end ('intact' condition). In other conditions, subjects listened to scrambled versions of the story, which were generated by dividing the original stimulus into segments of different timescales (paragraphs and words) and then permuting the order of these segments (similar to Lerner et al., 2011). To generate the scrambled stimuli, the story was segmented manually by identifying the end points of each word and paragraph. Two adjacent short words were assigned to a single segment in cases where they could not be separated. Following segmentation the intact story was scrambled at two time scales: short ('words' condition) and long ('paragraphs' condition). 12 s of neutral music and 3 s of silence preceded and 15 s of silence followed each playback in all conditions. These music and silence periods were discarded from all analyses.

The variable p_times contains the start time and end time (in seconds) of each paragraph, such that the paragraph-scrambled data can be re-ordered (unscrambled) to match the intact data:

p_times = [12 42; 42 60+56; 60+56 2*60+13; 2*60+13 2*60+26; 2*60+26 ...
3*60+13; 3*60+13 3*60+33; 3*60+33 4*60+45; 4*60+45 5*60+5; 5*60+5 ...
5*60+36; 5*60+36 6*60+2; 6*60+2 6*60+25; 6*60+25 6*60+58] - 12;
% starts at 12 because first 12s (music) were deleted from the BOLD time series
paragraph_TRs = round(p_times/1.5)+1;
scrambled_order = [12 11 3 8 1 5 4 6 10 9 7 2];
unscramble_TRs = paragraph_TRs(scrambled_order,:);

The variable paragraph_TRs is the same as p_times, but the units are brain volumes instead of seconds. 

Preprocessing 

Functional data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl), including correction for head motion and slice-acquisition time, spatial smoothing (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), and high-pass temporal filtering (140 s period). Preprocessed data were aligned to coplanar and high-resolution anatomicals and the standard MNI152 brain, and interpolated to 3-mm isotropic voxels.
